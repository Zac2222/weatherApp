Title: Weather App
Description: Create a working 5 day weather forcast
Github: https://github.com/Zac2222/weatherApp

notes on current version:
i have most things done, searching city, adding favorite, removing favorite, clicking from favorites to bring it up, scroll bar when favorites get too much and 5 day forcast.
what i need to work on is figuring out my my degree symbol is messing on on the min and max for the main display but not the forcast ones or the initial degrees.
I also need to add style to my 5 day forcast because its currently just text, and finally figure out all my local storage stuff i have yet to start on.
