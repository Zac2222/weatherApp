Title: Weather App
Description: Create a working 5 day weather forcast
Github: https://github.com/Zac2222/weatherApp

notes on current version:
i have most things done, searching city, adding favorite, removing favorite, clicking from favorites to bring it up, scroll bar when favorites get too much and 5 day forcast.
I need to add style to my 5 day forcast because its currently just text, and finally figure out all my local storage stuff i have yet to start on.
